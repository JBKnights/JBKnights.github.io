Hello! I am a learning and perception scientist and engineer, with extensive experience in developing and applying a mixture of classical and learning-based solutions to a wide variety of challenging problems. I am adaptable, proactive and highly self-motivated, with the ability to switch between autonomous and team work as required. I am excited by new challenges and eager to acquire new skills to address problems from novel and effective angles.  For more information, please check out my publications or CV.
