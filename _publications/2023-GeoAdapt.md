excerpt: 'This paper explores the topic of self-supervised domain adaptation for 3D place recognition, adapting networks to novel environments without ground truth supervision.  The proposed approach leverages geometric consistency to construct positive and negative pairs for training, and is shown through comprehensive experiments to not only improve performance but also to out-perform supervised adaptation.'

This paper explores the topic of self-supervised domain adaptation for 3D place recognition, adapting networks to novel environments without ground truth supervision.  The proposed approach leverages geometric consistency to construct positive and negative pairs for training, and is shown through comprehensive experiments to not only improve performance but also to out-perform supervised adaptation.
