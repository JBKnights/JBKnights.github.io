This paper proposes a pose-graph attentional graph neural network which compares key nodes between sequential and non-sequential sub-graphs for place recognition tasks.  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in the literature which employ frame-to-frame place recognition.
