This paper provides a comprehensive review and benchmark for the relatively unexplored topic of uncertainty estimation for 3D place recognition.  The results in the paper demonstrate that ensembling provides the most reliable estimation of place recognition uncertainty, albeit at a significant increase in computational cost.
