collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10160432
excerpt: This paper introduces Wild-Places, a challenging large-scale dataset for lidar place recognition in unstructured, natural environments. Wild-Places contains eight lidar sequences collected with a handheld sensor payload over the course of fourteen months, containing a total of 63K undistorted lidar submaps along with accurate 6DoF ground truth. This dataset contains multi-ple revisits both within and between sequences, allowing for both intra-sequence (i.e., loop closure detection) and inter-sequence (i.e., re-localisation) tasks. We also benchmark several state-of-the-art approaches to demonstrate the challenges that this dataset introduces, particularly the case of long-term place recognition due to natural environments changing over time.'
