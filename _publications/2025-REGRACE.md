excerpt: 'This paper proposes REGRACE, a scalable place recognition and registration pipeline for submaps. We produce
dense submaps by aggregating LiDAR scans into a single frame, expanding the sensor field of view and reducing object
occlusion. We also propose context-aware object descriptors by representing each submap as a graph. Finally, we introduce a new approach to detecting loop closures, which uses geometric consistency to classify revisits rather than embedding distance, helping detect far-away revisits.'
